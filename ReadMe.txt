Project-based Course Overview
Welcome!
Welcome to Building a Guessing Game using C++ Methods and C++ Control Constructs. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

Use the C++ standard input stream to input data from the user and store it in a variable.     

Employ a C++ decision construct to compare a guess with a random number.   

Use a while loop to allow for more than one guess.

By the end of this course, you will be able to write a C++ Application that uses methods, loops and decisions. 

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.

Build a Guessing Game C++ Methods and Control Constructs: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure
The hands on project on Build a Guessing Game C++ Methods and Control Constructs is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Research C++ online using a browser and discuss the ways in which C++ is used.
Task 2: Use the C++ standard input stream to input data from the user and store it in a variable. 
Task 3: Employ a C++ decision construct to compare a guess with a random number. 
Task 4: Use a while loop to allow for more than one guess. 
Task 5: Create a C++ static method to have the computer guess the random number.
Meet the Instructor
I'm Dave Dalsveen, welcome to the course! I hope you enjoy working with me on your Build a Guessing Game C++ Methods and Control Constructs project.

About Rhyme
This course runs on Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data you will need. So, you can just focus on the learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with C++ and Visual Studio Code pre-installed.

If you need help troubleshooting Rhyme, please refer to the 
Coursera Help Center
 for more information.

Earn a Certificate
After you have completed the Build a Guessing Game C++ Methods and Control Constructs hands-on project, you will be able to assess your knowledge using an ungraded assignment. Once you are comfortable with the concepts, take the final quiz, score higher than 80% to 
earn your certificate
